# Technology Integration Workflow

When adding support for a new technology or framework to the AI project:

## Setup Process

1. Create a new instruction file: `.github/instructions/{technology}.instructions.md`
   - Include technology-specific best practices
   - Add common patterns and conventions
   - Reference official documentation

2. Create supporting prompts in `.github/prompts/`
   - Use naming pattern: `{technology}-{action}.prompt.md`
   - Include scaffolding prompts for common tasks
   - Add debugging and troubleshooting prompts

3. Update VS Code settings if needed:
   - Add file associations for new extensions
   - Configure language-specific settings
   - Update syntax highlighting rules

## Testing Integration

- Test all new instruction files with actual AI interactions
- Validate prompt templates produce expected outputs
- Ensure consistency with existing project standards
- Document any special setup requirements

## Documentation

- Update main README.md with new technology capabilities
- Add examples of the new technology in action
- Reference the new instruction files from relevant rules
