# AI Scaffolding Workflow

This rule helps automate common tasks for managing the AI project scaffolding.

## When Adding New Technology Support

1. Create a new instruction file in `.github/instructions/{technology}.instructions.md`
2. Add technology-specific prompts in `.github/prompts/`
3. Update the main README.md with new capabilities
4. Test the new instructions with actual AI interactions
5. Update VS Code settings if needed for new file associations

## When Creating New Prompt Templates

1. Follow the naming convention: `{action}-{target}.prompt.md`
2. Use the standard prompt structure with context, instructions, parameters, and examples
3. Test the prompt with different scenarios
4. Document the prompt in the main README.md
5. Consider creating related instruction files if needed

## Quality Assurance

- Ensure all prompt files follow the established structure
- Verify instruction files are specific and actionable
- Test AI interactions with new content
- Maintain consistency across all scaffolding files
- Update documentation to reflect new capabilities

## Maintenance Tasks

- Regularly review and update existing prompts based on usage
- Keep instruction files aligned with current best practices
- Update VS Code settings for new features or file types
- Ensure all templates work with current AI model capabilities
- Gather feedback and iterate on prompt effectiveness

## File Organization

- Keep related prompts grouped logically
- Use clear, descriptive file names
- Maintain consistent formatting across all files
- Reference related files using @filename syntax in rules
- Keep the directory structure clean and intuitive
