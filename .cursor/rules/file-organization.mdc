# File Organization Standards

Maintain consistent structure and naming across the AI project:

## Directory Structure

```
.github/
├── instructions/     # Technology-specific guidance
├── prompts/         # Reusable prompt templates
└── workflows/       # GitHub Actions

.cursor/
└── rules/           # Cursor-specific rules
```

## Naming Conventions

- **Instructions**: `{technology}.instructions.md`
- **Prompts**: `{action}-{target}.prompt.md`
- **Rules**: `{concept}-{scope}.mdc` (kebab-case)

## Organization Principles

- Group related files logically within directories
- Use clear, descriptive file names that indicate purpose
- Maintain consistent formatting and structure across similar file types
- Reference related files using `@filename` syntax in rules

## File References

- Use relative paths when referencing other project files
- Include file references at the end of rules for context
- Keep cross-references up to date when moving or renaming files
