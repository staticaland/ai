# AI Development Standards

This project focuses on AI-assisted development workflows. Follow these standards:

## General Principles

- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Use TypeScript for type safety in JavaScript/Node.js projects
- Follow modern ES6+ syntax and features
- Implement proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- Add JSDoc comments for functions and classes
- Follow existing project structure and patterns
- Use environment variables for configuration values

## AI-Assisted Development

- Leverage GitHub Copilot and Cursor AI effectively
- Create reusable prompt templates for common tasks
- Maintain instruction files for consistent AI guidance
- Use descriptive naming that helps AI understand context
- Structure code in a way that provides clear context to AI tools

## Testing Standards

- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Aim for good test coverage without over-testing

## Documentation

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Keep README files up to date with project changes
- Document API endpoints with parameters and response formats
