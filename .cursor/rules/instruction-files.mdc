# Instruction File Guidelines

When creating or modifying instruction files in `.github/` or `.github/instructions/`:

## Purpose

Instruction files provide persistent context and guidelines to AI assistants:
- General guidelines in `copilot-instructions.md`
- Technology-specific guidance in `instructions/*.instructions.md`
- Domain-specific best practices and patterns

## Structure

- Start with a clear title and purpose
- Organize content into logical sections
- Use hierarchical headings (##, ###)
- Include specific, actionable guidelines
- Provide concrete examples where helpful
- Keep instructions focused and concise

## Content Guidelines

- Be specific rather than vague
- Include technology-specific best practices
- Reference project patterns and conventions
- Specify coding standards and formatting rules
- Include error handling and testing guidance
- Document architectural decisions and patterns

## Technology-Specific Instructions

For specialized instruction files:
- Name files as `{technology}.instructions.md`
- Focus on technology-specific best practices
- Include common patterns and anti-patterns
- Reference official documentation and standards
- Provide examples of proper usage

## Maintenance

- Keep instructions up to date with project evolution
- Review and update based on team feedback
- Ensure consistency across different instruction files
- Test instructions with actual AI interactions
