## VSCode Instructions - Make Small & Composable

Apply Cursor's documentation principles to VSCode instructions:

### Key Guidelines
- **Keep rules concise** - Under 500 lines is a good target
- **Split large concepts** into multiple, composable rules
- **Provide concrete examples** or referenced files when helpful
- **Avoid vague guidance** - Write rules like clear internal docs
- **Reuse rules** when repeating prompts in chat

### Action Items
